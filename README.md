#PDF Info Extractor

This program extracts e-mail addresses, phone numbers, websites, and highlighted text from PDF documents. 
Information is displayed in a table, and can then be imported to excel documents. 

To download and run the program:
+Download Zip
+Unzip files
+Navigate to build folder and click it
+Click on jfx folder
+Click on app folder
+Click on project-jfx jar file 

To make this I used a css template by Afsal Villan, Apache PDFBox library, and Auto-link.
